When running Ubiquiti Networks mPower devices with the "Controller" software the local log file of the device gets spammed with error messages. Additionally, for WiFi devices, it may happen that the WiFi connection drops for a few seconds.

This tool is an attempt to stop those controller connection attempts.

Use an SSH client and connect to your mPower device.
Enter the following commands

```
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magcode/mpower-tools/master/nocontroller.sh -O /etc/persistent/nocontroller.sh;chmod 755 /etc/persistent/nocontroller.sh;/etc/persistent/nocontroller.sh
save
reboot
```

Now the device will reboot.

You can check if the installation was successful:

Directly after the device is online again, connect with SSH and call

```
tail -f /var/log/messages
```

You will see some log messages like this

```
Sep  8 18:17:34 mpower-beamer user.err syslog: ace_reporter.reporter_fail(): server unreachable
Sep  8 18:17:34 mpower-beamer user.err syslog: ace_reporter.reporter_fail(): initial contact failed #4, url=http://mfi:6080/inform, rc=1
```

Approx. 3 minutes after booting you will see something like this:

```
Sep  9 09:00:28 mpower-sz daemon.info init: starting pid 4747, tty '/dev/null': '/bin/mcad -d'
Sep  9 09:00:29 mpower-sz daemon.info init: process '/bin/mcad' (pid 995) exited. Scheduling for restart.
Sep  9 09:00:30 mpower-sz daemon.info init: process '/bin/mcad -d' (pid 4747) exited. Scheduling for restart.
Sep  9 09:00:30 mpower-sz daemon.info init: starting pid 4904, tty '/dev/null': '/bin/mcad -d'
```

Now, the "server unreachable" messages should not appear anymore.
